//
//1) Transactional
//    Educate, Persuade, Influence, ??  (unique to your situation)
//2) Relationships and connections

//Communication can be transactional when there is no further objective.
//Sometimes there is a bigger opportunity to crete trust and relationships.
//And more we communicate, the more connections.
//
//Learning about others through communication

//1) Message (what are they saying)
//2) Delivery (how are they saying)
//3) Truthfulness
//4) Exaggeration
//5) Respect
//6) Empathy
