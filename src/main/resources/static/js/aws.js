            Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. 
            Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, 
            such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like AWS, GCP, Azure. 
            <b>Who is using</b>
            Organizations of every type, size, and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases, 
            such as data backup, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer-facing web applications.

    Each AZ will always have at least one other AZ that is geographically located within the same area, usually a city,

    Similarly to how utilizing multiple AZs within a region creates a level of high availability,  
    the same can be applied to utilizing multiple regions.  
    Interestingly, not all AWS services are available in every region. 
    Some services are classed as global services, such as AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM)

    Regions have both a ‘friendly’ name, indicating a location that can be viewed within the Management Console

    5) m5.8xlarge - 32 cpu, 128GB RAM, 10 Gbps

    Key pair(Pem/PPK) is required to create, in order to securely connect to EC2 instance using SSH 
    Security groups are firewall rules that control the traffic for your instance 
    Security groups works by referring IP address/port, and other security groups 
    Security groups can be attached to multiple instances, an instance can have multiple security groups 
    Security groups are locked down to region/VPC combination. 
    All inbound traffic is blocked and outbound traffic is allowed by default

    EC2 instances can be placed in AWS infrastructure using below placement group strategies.
